HISTORY:  This is a 66 year-old female with multiple self
inflicted stab wounds to the left chest, left neck and left
wrist resulting in a pneumothorax, hemothorax and ulnar
artery transection, also with very superficial stab wound to
the right wrist.

The patient was evaluated in the trauma bay and had chest
tubes placed, groin in place and aorta in place. The patient
had the left wrist explored and the bleeding vessel left
ulnar artery ligated.  The patient also underwent exploratory
laparotomy neck exploration which revealed a liver laceration
repaired with Chromic sutures.  Following operation the
patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
where she had a quick ventilator wean, was extubated and
transferred to the floor.

On the floor the patient's diet was slowly advanced. She was
tolerating regular diet. Foley catheter was removed.  IV
fluids were Hep-Locked.

Plastic surgery was involved for care of her multiple wounds.

Psychiatry evaluated the patient and determined that she will
require inpatient psychiatric treatment after her medical
issues are resolved.

Presently her trauma, surgical, orthopedic and plastic
surgical issues are resolved and she will be transferred to
psychiatric inpatient unit.

INDICATION:  Multiple stab wounds, s/p chest tube placement.

 CHEST, SINGLE VIEW AT 7:33:  Comparison is made to the film from 5:17.  The ET
 tube still terminates in the right main stem bronchus.  The kinked left chest
 tube is still present.  A second left chest tube has been placed with its tip
 overlying the left apex.  There is volume loss of the left lung with shift of
 mediastinal contents towards the left.  There is slightly increased opacity in
 the retrocardiac area with appearance of air bronchograms.  The right lung is
 clear.  The NG tube terminates in the stomach.  There is a small crescentic
 lucency along the surface of the left hemidiaphragm.

HISTORY:  Multiple stab wounds.

 AP CHEST:  ET tube extends into the right main stem bronchus.  There is
 hyperinflation of the right lung with mild shift of the heart and mediastinal
 structures to the left and volume loss in the left hemithorax.  A left sided
 chest tube has a pronounced acute angle just distal to the side hole.  No
 pneumothorax is seen. There is subcutaneous air along the left chest.  Vague
 opacity overlies the left lung base.  Adjacent to the chest tube is another
 opacity within the left upper lobe, possibly representing contusion. No
 obvious fractures are identified.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 

HISTORY:  Multiple stab wounds in chest and abdomen, hypotensive on site.

 TECHNIQUE: CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.
 Reconstruction images performed. 140 cc Optiray administered IV for this
 trauma patient.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Multiple pockets of air are demonstrated in the
 left anterior chest wall consistent with patient's multiple stab wounds. The
 left lung is collapsed.  There is a left pneumothorax despite placement of a
 chest tube in the left hemithorax. The left chest tube is kinked.  The
 collapsed left lung demonstrates significantly increased attenuation
 indicative of probable intraparenchymal hemorrhage in addition to the
 increased enhancement associated with atelectasis. There is also small amount
 of left pleural effusion of increased attenuation also consistent with
 hemorrhage.  The ET tube terminates in the right proximal main bronchus.  In
 the collapsed left lower lobe there is an area of irregularly near
 hyperattenuation which could represent a small blood vessel injury.

 In the anterior mediastinum at the level of the aortic arch there is somewhat
 increased attenuation in the mediastinal soft tissue which is suggestive of
 mediastinal hemorrhage.  However, the aortic arch appears unremarkable in
 contour and there is no evidence of aortic arch injury.  Therefore, this
 probably represents mediastinal venous hemorrhage.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Multiple small hypoattenuation lesions are
 demonstrated in the liver, with smooth margin, most likely representing small
 cysts. A small amount of ascites is demonstrated in the abdomen surrounding
 the liver, spleen and in the mesentery.  Certain areas of the ascites
 demonstrates increased attenuation indicative of some hemorrhage in the
 abdomen.  Layering hyperattenuation material is also demonstrated in the
 dependent portion of the stomach also suggestive of intragastric hemorrhage.
 The gastric tube terminates in the stomach. The pancreas, adrenals and left
 kidney appear unremarkable.  A small cyst is demonstrated in the right kidney.
 Note made of flattened IVC indicative of hypobolemic state.  There is
 increased mucosal enhancement of the stomach and small bowel.  There is also
 thickening of the right colonic wall presumably old related with hypovolemic
 state.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The distal ureters and bladder appear
 unremarkable. A Foley catheter is in place. There is no free pelvic fluid.

 Bone windows reveal no significant abnormalities.

HISTORY:  Multiple stab wounds, unresponsive.

 COMPARISONS: None.

 TECHNIQUE: CT of the head with no IV contrast followed by CT of the neck with
 IV contrast.  80 cc Optiray administered IV for this trauma patient.

 CT HEAD W/O IV CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of acute intracranial
 hemorrhage or infarcts. There is no abnormal intra or extra-axial collection.
 Mild mineralization in the basal ganglia region is demonstrated.  There is
 mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.

 Bone windows reveal no evidence of acute fracture. Air fluid levels are
 demonstrated in the left maxillary sinus and nasal pharyngeus most likely
 related to intubation.  There is also mucosal thickening of the right
 maxillary sinus.  The mastoid air cells are clear.

 CT NECK WITH IV CONTRAST:  Imaged portion of the upper chest demonstrates a
 right main bronchus intubation and left pulmonary post traumatic abnormality.
 Please see CT torso performed same day for detailed report.

 Multiple foci of subcutaneous air pockets are demonstrated in the left
 anterior and mid cervical soft tissues.  These correspond to the site of stab
 wounds, or could be secondary to gas tracking superiorly from the left
 pneumothrax. Both carotid arteries appear intact. An air collection is seen in
 close vicinity to the left internal jugular vein. The left internal jugular
 vein appears intact.

 Bone windows reveal no significant abnormality.

SOCIAL WORK 

NOTE:
     New trauma pt on CTIC/SICU admitted over the weekend on [**1-29**] s/p being found on floor at home with multiple self-inflicted stab wounds.  Pt lives with her 24 year old daughter, [**Name (NI) 10540**], and pt is divorced.  Pt is a 66 year old Japanese woman who has lived in the United States for 30+ years.  Pt has a history of command auditory hallucinations and had two psychiatric hospitalizations this summer and fall at [**Hospital 4112**] Hospital.  Pt reportedly has poor medication compliance.
     Pt has a 1:1 sitter and is being followed by psychiatry.  She is expected to transfer out to the floor soon.  Her daughter is not here at this time.  This SW met with pt briefly to introduce self.  Pt's first words to this SW were "the voice said that I am going to die".  Pt also stated that voice said that she has a "concussion on her feet".  Pt engages pleasantly and does not seem in obvious distress about the above comments.  When asked if there were things that staff could do to help her be more comfortable, pt said "please help my daughter".  Pt was not able to elaborate on this very much but this SW will alert floor SW of pt's arrival and will request support for pt's daughter.  Psychiatry will be seeing pt again today per their notes.
