[**12-23**] CXR: 

IMPRESSION:The ET tube tip is 2.5 cm above the
carina. The NG tube tip is within the stomach. The heart size
and the mediastinum are unremarkable. The lungs are clear. No
sizeable pleural effusion is identified.

[**12-25**] CXR: Heart size is normal. There is an ill-defined focal
opacity overlying left heart that likely represents atelectais
or possibly aspiration in L.L.L.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 21 y/o F w/hx of depression and prior suicide attempts
who presented to the ED on [**12-23**] after taking an unknown amount
of tylenol pm, clonazepam, ativan, and alcohol.  She was
intubated in the ED for altered mental status and was admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Her initial tylenol level was 113, EtOH 90.  She
was given NAC until her tylenol was zero.  She was exutubated
the day after admission.  She has been seen by psychiatry who
feel she warrants psychiatric admission now that her medical
issues have resolved.

intoxication has worn off.

(no posterior pharyngeal exudate, no LAD).  UA clean.
Leukocytosis resolved; no role for antibiotics at this time.
.
# Anemi

a: Unknown baseline. Likely due to aggressive IVF, vs
chronically low from menstruation.  Iron studies suggestive of
anemia of chronic disease.  Should get repeated at a later date.
.

a: Likely due to dehydration vs low-grade temp.
Improved with IV fluids.
