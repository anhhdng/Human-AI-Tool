HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known firstname 1022**] [**Known lastname 30375**] is a 39 year-old
female patient who suffered bilateral lower extremity
injuries.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Her right lower extremity underwent
emergent management for an open fracture with debridement and
ankle splinting fixation.  She subsequently presented for
staged reconstruction of her distal tibia. She was taken to
the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] on [**2179-9-3**] when she
underwent open reduction internal fixation of the fibula and
tibia for the pilon type fracture as well as syndesmotic
repair. She tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the
recovery room without incident.  She had previously undergone
open reduction internal fixation of the left tibia by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2179-8-21**].  She was eventually discharged to rehab
with clean wounds, to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**].



DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Anticoagulation in the form of
Lovenox and pain control medication in the form of oral
narcotics.

 Comparison is made to trauma chest radiograph of [**2179-8-21**].

 

INDICATION:  Tachypnea and oxygen desaturation.

 Allowing for scoliosis, the heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.
 There has been development of an area of patchy consolidation in the right
 infrahilar region, which may be due to acute aspiration, or developing
 pneumonia.  The remainder of the lungs are clear, and there is no evidence of
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

INDICATION:  25 foot fall with gross deformities.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of right and left knees, two views of the right and left
 ankle, two views of right and left foot.

 FINDINGS:

 Left lower extremity:
 There is a displaced, angulated, comminuted fracture of the distal left tibial
 diaphysis, with lateral displacement and anterior angulation of the distal
 fracture fragment with respect to the proximal fracture fragment and with
 several smaller comminuted fracture fragments. There is a laterally displaced,
 comminuted fracture of the left distal fibular diaphysis.  There is
 approximately 1.6 cm of override of the fibular fracture fragments and
 approximately 1.4 cm of override of the tibial fracture fragments.  No left
 knee joint effusion is identified.  No fractures are identified about the left
 knee or visualized portion of the distal left femur. The left knee joint space
 is preserved.

 The left ankle mortise appears congruent.  Visualization of fine osseous
 detail within the left ankle is limited by the overlying cast material.

 LEFT FOOT, TWO VIEWS:  Visualization of fine detail is limited by the presence
 of overlying cast material.  There is well corticated unusual contour of the
 left fifth metatarsal, possibly representing old healed trauma or congenital
 variant.  A questionable lucency overlying the proximal aspect of the distal
 phalanx of the first digit likely represents artifact from overlying cast
 material.  The joint spaces are preserved.

 RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY:  Visualization of fine osseous detail is limited by the
 presence of overlying cast material.  There is a displaced fracture of the
 distal right tibial metaphysis, with medial displacement of the distal
 fracture fragment with respect to the proximal fracture fragment and with
 approximately 5 cm of override.  There is an additional displaced and
 angulated fracture of the distal right fibular diaphysis, with medial
 displacement and anterior angulation of the distal fracture fragment with
 respect to the proximal fracture fragment.  There is approximately 1.2 cm of
 override.  No definite joint effusion is identified at the right knee and no
 fractures are identified in the visualized portion of the distal right femur
 or proximal right tibia or fibula.  There is a suggestion of separation of the
                                                             (Over)

 distal tibial and fibular articulation at the ankle mortise although this may
 be positional in nature.

 RIGHT FOOT, TWO VIEWS:  Visualization of fine osseous detail is limited by the
 presence of overlying cast material.  Visualization of the talus is markedly
 limited by the presence of overlying tibial and fibular fracture fragments.
 There is a linear lucency within the two sets of sesamoid bones at the first
 MTP joint, likely representing bipartite sesamoid although fractured sesamoid
 is not excluded.  No other definite fractures are identified.

HISTORY:  Status post 30-feet fall.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial images through the chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV
 contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.  Optiray was
 administered due to patient debility.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  The aorta is normal in appearance.  The heart
 and pericardium are normal.  There are no pleural or pericardial effusions,
 and no pneumothorax.  There is bibasilar dependent atelectasis.  There are no
 pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph nodes.  The
 airways are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.  Note is
 made of bilateral breast implants.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
 adrenal glands, and left kidney are normal.  The unopacified loops of large
 and small bowel are normal.  The descending aorta is normal.  The right kidney
 is atrophic and contains a 2mm punctate calcification.  There is no free fluid
 or free air in the abdomen. There are no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
 retroperitoneal lymph nodes.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The uterus and ovaries are normal.  There is
 no free air or free fluid in the pelvis.  The unopacified loops of bowel are
 normal.  There are no pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes.
 There is a Foley catheter within the bladder.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no fractures within the ribs or visualized thoracic,
 lumbar, or sacral spine.  There is a convex right thoracic scoliosis.

HISTORY:  Status post fall from 30 feet.

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, shift of
 normally midline structures, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.  The [**Doctor Last Name 37**]-white
 matter differentiation remains intact.  The osseous structures are normal.
 There are polyps Vs. retention cysts in both maxillary sinuses.  There is
 minimal mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus.  The other sinuses are well
 aerated.

INDICATION:  Status post MVA.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable pelvis and AP portable supine chest.

 FINDINGS:

 AP CHEST:  Visualization of fine osseous and soft tissue detail is limited by
 the presence of overlying trauma board artifact.  There is S-shaped thoracic
 scoliosis.  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 are probably within normal limits allowing for supine positioning.  No
 pneumothorax.  No focal pulmonary consolidation or pleural effusion.  No
 fractures are identified within the visualized osseous structures.

 AP PELVIS:  Visualization of fine osseous and soft tissue detail is limited by
 the presence of overlying trauma board artifact.  Allowing for this, no
 fractures are identified within the pelvis and visualized portions of the
 proximal femurs.  The visualized bowel gas pattern appears unremarkable.  A
 linear lucency overlying the left transverse process of L4 vertebra is
 contiguous with an adjacent soft tissue lucency and not felt to represent a
 fracture.

INDICATION:  Fracture.

 COMPARISON:  Radiograph [**2179-8-21**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT through the right lower extremity at 1.25 slice
 thickness with coronally and sagittally reformatted images.

 FINDINGS:  An external fixation device is present.  There is an oblique
 fracture through the distal fibular shaft, with approximately 6 mm of lateral
 displacement of the distal fracture fragment.  There is an obliquely oriented
 fracture line through the posterior distal tibia, with approximately 3 mm of
 posterior displacement of the distal fragment, and approximately 4 mm of
 superior dislocation of that same fragment, which widens the posterior ankle
 joint space.  A tiny fracture fragment is present within the joint space.
 Additionally, there is a transverse fracture through the medial malleolus,
 with approximately 1 cm of separation of the anterior aspect of the fracture.
 Geographic, slightly sclerotic lesion along the medial aspect of the proximal
 tibial metadiaphysis is again noted, likely representing residua of non-
 ossifying fibroma.

 Small amounts of gas are visible within the ankle joint and within the soft
 tissues surrounding the ankle joint.
