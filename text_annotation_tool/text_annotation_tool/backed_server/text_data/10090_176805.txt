HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 27-year-old male with a
history of depression, panic attacks and multiple suicide
attempts was found down by his father on the day of
admission. His father spoke to him at 7:00 a.m. that morning
when he sounded groggy and had a slurred speech. He did not
show up at work and that is when his father went to his
apartment and found down with a bag over his head snoring. He
called the emergency services. At that time, the patient
started vomiting pills. The pill bottles were found with the
patient. These were as follows: Seroquel 200 mg tablets last
filled [**2124-1-5**], 28 tablets, no tabs left in the
pill bottle, carisoprodol 350 mg tablets last filled [**2124-1-5**], 56 tablets were filled at that time, none left in
the bottle, lorazepam 1 mg tablets last filled [**2124-1-5**], 42 tablets, none left in the bottle, cyclobenzaprine 10
mg tablets last filled [**1-10**], #30 in number, 10 left in
the bottle, Cymbalta 60 mg tablets last filled [**2123-12-17**], 30 in number, only 4 left in the bottle.

In the emergency department, his vitals were temperature of
35.2 with a bear hugger, initially it was unable to register,
pulse of 79, blood pressure 90/59, after 4 liters of IV
fluids. He was intubated for airway protection and given his
vomiting. He received 50 grams of charcoal with sorbitol. He
had a negative head CT and a C-spine CT as well. EKG was
within normal limits. He was admitted to the intensive care
unit for further care.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Depression. He was discharged from a psychiatric facility
    1 week ago.
2.  Panic attacks.
3.  Multiple suicide attempts. Per chart, he has had at least
    7 suicide attempts since [**2118**], most recently 10 days ago
    by cutting himself. He has also tried to stab himself in
    [**2123-10-24**], with an Exacto knife, overdose with
    Seroquel, Zanaflex and Klonopin.



MEDICATIONS:  Seroquel, carisoprodol, lorazepam,
cyclobenzaprine, Cymbalta.



ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  He works at [**Hospital3 1196**] in
nuclear medicine. No alcohol use. History of tobacco use. Has
a girlfriend with bipolar disorder.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 97.8
without a bear hugger, blood pressure 108/67, pulse 76. These
vitals were taken in the intensive care unit. He was
saturating 100% on the ventilator. Good urine output.
Appeared intubated, sedated but followed commands. Head and
neck exam were mild pallor, NG tube and endotracheal tube
were in place. The pupils were bilaterally reactive, equal.
Neck: C-spine collar was in place. Lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular 

exam: Regular rate
and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Abdomen soft,
nontender, hypoactive bowel sounds. Extremities: No edema, 2+
distal pulses. Neurologic 

exam: PERRL, intermittently
following commands. Skin warm and dry.



LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, he had a hematocrit of 29
that remained stable throughout the admission ranging from 27
to 29. There was 1 spurious value of 23.8, however, on
repeating a few hours later it was back up to 29. Normal
coagulation panel. Chem7 was unremarkable. ALT, AST were
normal. Alkaline phosphatase was normal. Amylase was 318.
Normal lipase. Cardiac enzymes remained normal. Calcium at
admission was 7.9, however, it could be corrected with
albumin of 3.3. Ionized calcium was normal at 1.16. Normal
TSH, normal haptoglobin. Serum toxicology showed positive for
tricyclics. Normal lactate. UA was normal. Urine toxicology
was normal. Urine culture at the time of discharge was
pending and was normal. Blood culture sent out the day prior
to discharge was normal at the time of dictating this
discharge summary. Chest x-ray, PA and lateral, showed no
evidence of pneumonia. This was done the day prior to
discharge. CT of the cervical spine revealed no fracture,
anything suggestive of trauma. CT head revealed no signs of
intracranial bleed or infarct or mass effect or fractures.
Chest x-ray on admission did not reveal any infiltrate.

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Intubation, extubation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Severe depression and history of multiple suicide attempts:
The patient after being initially intubated
for airway protection he was extubated within less than 24
hours later and tolerated that well. He was given Charcoal in
the emergency room. No EKG changes suggestive of Q-T
prolongation were noted. No signs or symptoms suggestive of
serotonin syndrome were noted. As well as toxicology followed
the patient while in the intensive care unit. After
stabilization, he was transferred to the floor with 1 to 1
sitter. He displayed ongoing suicidal ideation during the
hospitalization. All further medications that he had
overdosed on were withheld during the hospital course.
Psychiatry evaluation was obtained who recommended inpatient
psychiatry admission. He is eventually being discharged to an
inpatient psychiatric facility ([**Hospital1 **] 4) for further management of
his severe depression and history of multiple suicidal attempts
and the current ideation.

Anemia. His hematocrit except for the spurious value of 23
remained stable between 27 and 29. There was no acute
evidence of bleeding, however, what was noted was the patient
had multiple bruises and cuts on his extremities in various
stages of development. These probably were from past suicide
attempts that could have led to chronic blood loss causing
his anemia. There was no evidence of hemolysis on his blood
work and no evidence of acute GI or other bleeding. His
hematocrit should be followed up as an outpatient. There is
no acute need for blood transfusion at the time of discharge.

Fever. The day prior to discharge the patient had a fever up
to 101.9. A fever workup was initiated. Chest x-ray revealed
no pneumonia or infiltrate. Urinalysis was normal. Urine
culture was normal at the time of discharge. Blood cultures
were drawn as well which were normal at the time of
discharge. The patient had no symptoms suggestive of any
infection. The fever defervesced overnight with resolution.
The patient was afebrile for 24 hours prior to discharge.

Hypocalcemia. The initial blood tests revealed hypocalcemia,
however, after correction with the low albumin this was
correctable. His ionized calcium was also confirmed to be
normal. There were no symptoms or signs suggestive of
hypocalcemia but this could have been a spurious value.

The patient is being be discharged for further care to the
inpatient psychiatric facility. At the time of discharge, the
patient was medically stable to be discharged for his further
psychiatry needs.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable from medical point of view.



DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Further care to be taken over by the
physicians at the psychiatry unit. The patient should call
and follow-up with the primary care physician after
discharge.



DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Nicotine patch.
2.  Sumatriptan subcutaneous dose once daily as needed for
    migraine headaches.
3.  Naproxen 250 mg tablets, 2 tablets every 8 hours as
    needed for migraine headaches.
4.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. daily.



DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Severe depression.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 

INDICATION:  27-year-old man with overdose, found down, to evaluate for
 injury.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT of the cervical spine was performed.

 No prior studies for comparison.

 FINDINGS:

 The cervical vertebral bodies are normal in height, and alignment.  No
 evidence of fractures are noted.  A rotary displacement of C1 to the right of
 C2  could most likely be positional, rather than a subluxation- correlate
 clinically.. The intervertebral disc spaces are normal.

 The endotracheal tube is misplaced, with the inflated balloon in the
 supraglottic space. This needs immediate attention, and this information was
 telephoned directly to the ED attending caring for the patient.

 The craniovertebral junction is unremarkable.
